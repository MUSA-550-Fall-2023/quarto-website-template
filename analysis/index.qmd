# Analysis

This section includes examples of technical analysis done using Jupyter notebooks.
Each sub-section highlights different types of analyses and visualizations.
In particular, it highlights that we can easily publish interactive visualizations
produced with packages such as hvPlot, altair, or Folium, without losing
any of the interactive features. 

On this page, you might want to share more introductory or background information about 
the analyses to help guide the reader.
